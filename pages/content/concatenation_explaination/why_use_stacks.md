## Why Stacks?
Good question.

Was it because it was easier to make a programming language with a stack?

Was it because I want Amanatsu to be different?

Was it because I genuinely believe that stack-based programming languages give you a different experience to that of Python or JS?

Yes, yes and yes.

- Programming languages are complex to make and it is easier if they
confine to a simple ruleset where I can tweak the design of the programming language without
tweaking the specifics

- Too many new programming languages pop up with minor tweaks on a traditional formula.
They look boring, and overly inspired by C.
The fact is that C is about 50 years old and there's probably better ways to do some things but no one really cares because programming languages are hard to make. 
There's a few hidden gems which really do echo new ways of thinking and new ways of doing things, like Zig (which Amanatsu is written in, how quaint!) and Racket (concise and efficient), and Rust (fast and secure but too confusing for me :P).

- Yes. If you have stuck with only Python, or only JS, try something which is completely different. Try a Lisp, try a functional language, try a purely object-oriented language, and finally try a stack-based language. 
They each have something very different to offer and you can use these types of programming in your favourite programming language.
Amanatsu for example states simplicity and minimalism, something that other languages desperately need.
